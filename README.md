# Consumer and producer with asynchronous programming

Consumer and producer problem with random portions to buffers using asynchronous programming with [ActiveObject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object) design pattern.
Solution made for concurrency theory course in AGH UST. <br>

Main runs consumer and producer simulation data with customizable parameters suck as:
- number of producers
- number of consumers
- size of buffer
- time of doing extra task while waiting for answer
- time to wait for statistics
